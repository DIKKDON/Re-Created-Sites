			<h1>What’s an IRA?</h1>
			<p>IRA stands for Individual Retirement Account. When you <br>open an Acorns Later IRA, we automatically select the<br> right plan for your lifestyle and goals.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item" id="section3-grid-item-2">
			<h1>Why should I invest in an IRA?</h1>
			<p>Legendary investor, Warren Buffett said, "The most <br>important investment you can make is in yourself." We <br>agree. IRAs can help you save for retirement with <br>potential tax advantages!</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item" id="section3-grid-item-3">
			<h1>How much money do I need to open an<br> Acorns Later account?</h1>
			<p>Acorns was founded on the principle, "From acorns<br> mighty oaks do grow." Just as with our investment<br> accounts, you can begin investing with just $5.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="grid-item" id="section3-grid-item-4">
			<h1>Why do we call this Acorns Later?</h1>
			<p>Because 'retirement' doesn't mean what it used to for a<br> lot of people. It used to be something you could count <br>on — and when it came, you were going to pursue what <br>you love. Today, many don't believe they will retire, and<br> others are doing what they love now. So we call it Acorns<br> Later because it will allow you to save - with potential tax<br> advantages - for even later in life.</p>
